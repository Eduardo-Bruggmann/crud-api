## Postman Setup

To quickly test the API, I provide a Postman collection and environment preset.

1. Open Postman.
2. Import all collections: `<name>.postman_collection.json`
3. Import the environment: `Localhost.postman_environment.json`
4. Select the environment in Postman.
5. Update the `API_URL` variable to point to your local or deployed backend.
6. Start sending requests! Each request already has sample bodies for easier testing.
